# Exercise-Tracker

This full stack single page application allows users to track their exercises. Node and Express functionality works with the MongoDB database to allow for CRUD operations with the React UI.

Future implementation of the app will focus on adding authentication to further secure data and allow users to access their own saved data from previous sessions.
